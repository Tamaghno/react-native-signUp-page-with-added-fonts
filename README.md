# react-native-signUp-page-with-added-fonts
simple signUp application page using react-native (also integrated google fonts)

PS: the added fonts are pre-downloaded google fonts and they're stored in the android/app/src/main/assets/fonts location.
This is the required location to make your applied fonts actually work. No external library is needed . Aso no need to manually link to any third party fonts.
